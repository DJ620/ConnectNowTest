# ConnectNow Assessment Test

This is DJ Hersh's assessment test for ConnectNow. The webpage functions just as described in the brief. Upon load, there is a 2 second delay before a list of games appears. Before they appear, there is a loading message. The user has the ability to filter the list of games by name and rating (score). The games can also be viewed in order by name, rating (score), or by release date. I have also added the functionality of switching between ascending and descending the order by clicking on the arrow next to the 'Order By' selection. If no games meet the current filter, a message displays letting the user know that no games meet that search. The page is fully responsive thanks to a combination of media queries and bootstrap classes.
